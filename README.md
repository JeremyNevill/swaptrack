# SwapTrack

## Description

[SwapTrack](http://swaptrack.com) is a web application to help people swap collectables, such as World Cup Football Stickers.

Users add the items they have, what they are missing, and compare with friends to see what swaps they have.


## Technical 

The app is written in javascript using AngularJs and uses the realtime BAAS Firebase.


# Get Started

The public hosted version is located at [SwapTrack.com](http://swaptrack.com)


## History

[SwapTrack.com](http://swaptrack.com) was coded up during the first few games of the 2014 Football World Cup.  I was collecting stickers for the championship (like all good grown men) and needed to do a bit of swapping.

I also wanted to do a bit of coding using Firebase as it looked interesting and AngularJs was a good fit for the front end.
